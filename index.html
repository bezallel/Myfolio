    <h2>ISOLDE – Intelligent Simulation of Load Distribution in Emergencies</h2>

      <ul class="project-meta">
  <li><strong>Category:</strong> Energy resilience / grid simulation</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Python (Flask), data modeling, real-time UI, Chart.js</li>
</ul>

<div class="project-description">
  <p><strong>Motivation:</strong>  
  ISOLDE was built in response to the severe outages caused by Storm Éowyn in Ireland, where large numbers of customers lost power and ESB Networks reported extensive grid damage. The event highlighted the need to understand how stored energy could support communities when infrastructure fails.</p>

  <p><strong>Overview:</strong>  
  ISOLDE is a real-time simulator that models how a micro-grid or community battery system responds to a major outage. It shows daily load behavior, how storage accumulates during low demand, and how stored energy is allocated to critical areas when the grid goes down.</p>

  <p><strong>How It Works:</strong>  
  A Flask backend provides load profiles and station metadata through "Data" and "Stations". The frontend displays a live Chart.js load graph, a battery state indicator, and a panel showing which stations receive stored energy during Island Mode.</p>

  <p><strong>Impact:</strong>  
  The simulator helps utilities, planners, and communities test emergency energy strategies and evaluate priorities, required storage capacity, and how long support can realistically last.</p>

  <p class="disclaimer"><em>Disclaimer:</em> This is a demonstration project that uses synthetic or publicly available data and is not an operational system.</p>

       data-text="Storm Éowyn caused severe, widespread outages across Ireland, leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity. 
       The event exposed how fragile distribution networks become during climate-intensified storms.<br><br>
       <span class='notice'>Objective:</span> Create a real-time simulation tool that models how stored energy can be accumulated during off-peak hours and redistributed to critical areas when the grid fails—demonstrating a proof-of-concept micro-grid resilience system.">

  <!-- STEP 1: MODELING LOAD + FORECASTING -->
  <div class="scroll-item" 
       data-heading="Step 1: Forecasting and Load Modeling"
       data-text="The system begins by modeling electricity demand using historical load data. 
       A Prophet forecasting model is trained to understand daily and weekly patterns, allowing ISOLDE to estimate future consumption and identify high-demand periods.<br><br>
       During these peaks, a portion of the load is classified as 'flexible' and safely shifted; creating predictable opportunities for controlled battery charging.">

  <!-- STEP 2: THE CODE (BATTERY + STORM SIMULATION) -->
  <div class="scroll-item"

       data-text="ISOLDE simulates how a community battery behaves before, during, and after a storm. 
       Stored energy builds during low-demand hours. When an outage window is detected, the battery switches into island mode and begins powering the system.">

  <div class="scroll-item"

       data-text="The interface visualizes multiple layers of the system in real time:
       <br>• Original load - Total electricity demand at the moment  
       <br>• Flexible load - Portion of electricity that can be shifted to off-peak times  
       <br>• Served load during demand  
       <br>• Battery state-of-charge, growing during off-peak periods<br><br>
       Users can observe energy storage accumulating as demand decreases, creating resilience capacity before a storm hits.">

       The UI displays:
